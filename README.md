## Overview

This repository presents a **public research abstract** for the **BoonMind Framework** — a new direction in *observer-inclusive recursive systems* and *harmonic-constrained convergence*.

The materials here communicate:

- Research thesis and theoretical direction  
- Experimental claims and conceptual boundaries  
- Citation and provenance for priority recognition  
- A request for qualified collaborators and reviewers  

No full source code, production algorithms, or internal system parameters are published here.

## Research Summary

BoonMind explores the hypothesis that:

> *Some classes of “unsolvable” or divergent computational problems appear unsolvable because the problem formulation excludes the observer, feedback loops, or bounded recursion.*

This work introduces:

### **Recursive Harmonic Convergence (RHC)**  
A model for self-stabilizing recursive systems using:
- Bounded feedback loops  
- Observer-coupled damping  
- Harmonic state convergence rather than brute force minimization  

Observed properties in early experiments:

- Rapid convergence  
- Divergence suppression  
- Stable recursive oscillation without chaotic collapse  

These findings are **preliminary and pre-peer-review**, shared to establish provenance and invite critical collaboration.

## Public Contribution Goals

This repository exists to:

✅ Establish publicly timestamped priority of discovery  
✅ Invite collaboration, critique, and replication interest  
✅ Provide structured citation points for adjacent research  
✅ Form working groups prior to formal publication or deployment
