## Overview

This repository presents a **public research abstract** for the BoonMind framework — a new direction in *observer-inclusive recursive systems* and *harmonic-constrained convergence*.

The contents here communicate:

- The research thesis and theoretical direction  
- Experimental claims and conceptual boundaries  
- Citation and provenance for priority recognition  
- A request for qualified collaborators and reviewers  

This repository **does not contain full source code, production algorithms, or tunable parameters**. These remain in controlled private archives pending formal publication, IP review, and/or collaborative agreements.

## Research Summary

BoonMind explores the hypothesis that:

> *Some classes of “unsolvable” or divergent computational problems appear so because the problem definition excludes the role of the observer, feedback, and bounded recursion.*

The work introduces **Recursive Harmonic Convergence (RHC)** as a framework for ensuring stable self-referential iteration through constrained feedback loops, harmonic damping, and observer coupling.

Initial experiments in constraint-solving, pattern emergence, and recursive stabilization demonstrate:

- Rapid state convergence  
- Reduced divergence in self-referential systems  
- Non-chaotic behavior in bounded recursive feedback  

These results are **preliminary, directional, and not yet formally peer-reviewed**.

## Public Contribution Goals

This repository exists to:

✅ Establish **public provenance and priority** for the framework  
✅ Invite **collaboration, replication, and academic dialogue**  
✅ Provide citation references for researchers exploring adjacent ideas  
✅ Form working groups prior to formal submission or product release

## 📌 What Is *Not* Included Here

This repository intentionally excludes:

⛔ Production implementations  
⛔ Tuned model constants or feedback coefficients  
⛔ Executable training or inference code  
⛔ Optimization parameters  
⛔ Runtime logic that enables reproduction at scale  

These will only be shared under:

- Peer-review processes  
- Formal collaboration agreements  
- Institutional or commercial partnerships  
- Controlled research access

## Collaboration & Access Requests

Researchers, institutions, or reviewers wishing to access controlled materials may request access by:

1. Opening a GitHub Issue titled:  
   **“Request RHC Research Access”**
2. Including:
   - Name and affiliation
   - Intended scope of review or replication
   - Whether access is academic or commercial
   - Timeline and use case

All access is granted on a **case-by-case basis** and may require a lightweight collaboration agreement.
