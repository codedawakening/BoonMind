This work is released for **acknowledgment, citation, academic review, interface interoperability, and governed collaboration only.**

This is **not** an open-source license.  
This is **not** a Creative Commons license.  
This is **not** a commercial commons license.

The materials in this repository may *not* be used to recreate, reproduce, approximate, train on, or distill the underlying system.

## ✅ **Permitted Uses**

You may:

- Read, reference, and cite this work
- Redistribute the repository in unmodified form for academic or review purposes
- Inspect interface specifications and API surfaces
- Build external systems that *call into* the interface without reproducing internal logic
- Conduct black-box safety audits
- Submit formal collaboration or research access requests
- Publish research *about* the system so long as it does not provide replication detail

---

## ❌ **Prohibited Uses (without written license agreement)**

You may **not**:

- Train or fine-tune AI models using this material
- Reverse engineer or reconstruct system behavior
- Derive internal decision mechanics, governance lattices, recursion methods, arbitration cores, or reasoning topology
- Build derivative models, frameworks, engines, or governance layers
- Commercialize, embed, or redistribute modified implementations
- Claim compatibility, equivalence, or lineage to BoonMind systems without cryptographic verification issued by the author
- Use the work to improve or train proprietary AI systems

## 🔐 **Non-Extractability Clause**

All public materials, APIs, and interfaces are intentionally **non-invertible, non-generative, and non-reconstructive**.  
Any attempt to derive core mechanics, lattice topology, arbitration logic, or underlying system behavior from public surfaces constitutes a license violation.

---

## 🤝 **Collaboration**

Access to protected methods, inference engines, governance cores, or replication material requires:

1. A formal collaboration request
2. Identity and intent review
3. A signed **Closed-Core Collaboration Agreement (CCCA)**
4. Staged access authorization

Collaboration requests may be submitted via GitHub issues tagged:
**`BPGL Access Request`**

## 🧠 **Attribution Requirements**

Approved public references must follow the format:

> *“Referenced under BoonMind BPGL-1.0. Not an open-source or replication license.”*

At no point may attribution imply that replication rights, training rights, or derivative rights were granted.

---

## ⚖️ Enforcement

Unauthorized uses may result in:

- Cease and desist orders
- Mandatory destruction of derivative assets
- Disqualification from collaboration pathways
- Public disclosure of breach
- All further legal remedies available to the author

---

## 🍃 Intent

This license exists to balance:

✔ open academic discourse  
✔ reproducible scientific claims  
✔ safety-critical governance research  

with:

✖ unbounded commercial extraction  
✖ unsafe system replication  
✖ model distillation of protected cores
